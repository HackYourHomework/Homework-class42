- Run the unmodified program and confirm that problem described occurs.
- Refactor the `rollDie()` function from callback-based to returning a
  promise.
- Change the calls to `callback()` to calls to `resolve()` and `reject()`.
- Refactor the code that call `rollDie()` to use the promise it returns.
- Does the problem described above still occur? If not, what would be your
  explanation? Add your answer as a comment to be bottom of the file.

/*
  In the previous code, the success callback is called when the die has finished rolling, regardless of whether it rolled off the table or not. 
  That means that even if the die rolled off the table, the success message would still be printed out, along with the error message.

In the second code, the reject method is called when the die rolls off the table, which triggers the catch block to execute, and the error message is printed out. 
The resolve method is only called when the die has finished rolling and has not rolled off the table, 
which triggers the then block to execute, and the success message is printed out.
